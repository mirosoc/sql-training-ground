# sql-training-ground

This repository contains my solved exercises in **MySQL** – from basic queries to more advanced tasks.  
The goal is to practice SQL step by step and document my learning progress.

## Structure
- `beginner/` – simple queries, SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, etc.
- `intermediate/` – JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries.
- `advanced/` – stored procedures, triggers, optimization.

## Notes
This is a learning project. I will gradually add new exercises as I make progress.
